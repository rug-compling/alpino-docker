Wat is Alpino in Docker

 - updates

[1mWindows[0m

If you are using [3mDocker for Windows[0m you need [4malpino.cmd[0m.
In the examples below substitute [4malpino.cmd[0m for [4malpino.bash[0m.

If you are using [3mDocker Toolbox[0m you need [4malpino.bash[0m.


[1mLinux, Mac[0m

You need [4malpino.bash[0m.


Upgrade
-------

If you have been using an older version of [4malpino.bash[0m, you may need to
update the Docker image, before using the new script:

[36m    alpino.bash -u[0m


Starting Alpino in Docker
-------------------------

There are two ways of starting Alpino in Docker.

  [1m1--[0m This brings you into a bash shell inside Docker, where you can
      run any command:

[36m    alpino.bash $HOME/alpino[0m

Inside the shell, there is a virtual directory [4m~/data[0m that corresponds
to the real directory you gave as an argument to the script, in this
case [4m$HOME/alpino[0m. You use it to save and access data on your regular
file system.


  [1m2--[0m You can also run a single command, without going to the shell
      first, for example, running the Alpino program:

[36m    alpino.bash $HOME/alpino Alpino[0m

In this case, there is no directory [4m~/data[0m in Docker, but there is
[4m/work/data[0m with the same purpose.


Examples of running Alpino inside Docker
----------------------------------------

Inside Docker, you can run Alpino interactively (shown below), or as a command line
tool (shown in another info page).

If you have access to an X11 server, then this starts the Alpino GUI:

[36m    Alpino[0m

This starts and interactive version of Alpino without the GUI:

[36m    Alpino -notk[0m
